## ðŸ“‚ Repository Instructions

### Branch Workflow
- **Protected branches:** `main` and `dev`  
  - `main` â†’ stable production branch  
  - `dev` â†’ integration branch for all features and bugfixes
- **Feature branches:**  
  1. Create a GitHub issue for your task or bug  
  2. Create a branch using this format:
     ```
     feature/{issue-number}-short-description
     ```
     Example:
     ```
     feature/7-add-search-bar
     ```
  3. Push the branch and open a Pull Request to `dev`  
  4. Reference the issue in the PR with:
     ```
     Fixes #{issue-number}
     ```
     This will automatically close the issue when the PR merges.

### Pull Requests
- PRs must be **approved by the Code Owner** (currently only the project lead).  
- **Do not push directly to `main` or `dev`** â€” always use feature branches.  
- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or bug fix for easier review.

## ðŸš€ Get started with Expo

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
````

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

* [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
* [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
* [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
* [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory.
This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## ðŸ§¹ Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
